1. Get a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) and log in.
2. Find the page you want to edit, and click the `Edit` link at the top right.
3. Make your change in the editor.
4. Click the Save icon, enter a description of your change, and hit `commit`.

Your change will be entered into the [pull request queue for discussion](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/pulls)
before being merged into the master version.

If you're more familiar with GitHub, you can of course use the standard fork / pull request model.

## The Rules

* *Anything* can be changed.
* All contributions and discussions are public, and should take place as part of a pull request.
* Plain English is essential - follow the GDS style guide if you can, or use [Hemingway](http://hemingwayapp.com) to test readability. Try to avoid political weasel-words.
* Make changes small, self-contained, and simple. Large changes will take a lot longer to get agreed upon and merged. Small is agile.
* All content is public domain. By submitting a change, you agree that you are putting your work into the public domain. See [the full license](license.html) for details.

## Merging Changes

We are not using a straight majority voting system, as it's not suited to a long-tail participation model, certainly not with our current contributor numbers. Instead, we're using a type of blackballing, where anyone can block, but only a relatively small proportion are required to actively agree in order to accept a change.

Changes will be merged when 20% of existing contributors excluding the proposer (currently 2) have approved the pull request with a 'thumbs-up' symbol in the comments. This proportion may change later, based on how active contributors are; it would be good to increase it, but at the moment this is a practical level.

Any contributor can block a merge by including a 'thumbs-down' symbol, as long as they include constructive reasoning and alternative proposals. A change cannot be merged as long as there are blocks in place.

Votes are counted by an automated script, which sets the GitHub build status on the pull request depending whether enough votes have been received. See the [Open Votes](http://votebot.openpolitics.org.uk) page for details and vote counts. Changes are merged by a [repository administrator](https://github.com/orgs/openpolitics/members) once consensus is reached.

Once an author has had a change merged in, they will become an existing contributor and thus can vote on new changes.
