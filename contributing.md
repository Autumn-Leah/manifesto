1. Get a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) and log in.
2. Find the page you want to edit, and click the `Edit` link at the top right.
3. Make your change in the editor.
4. Click the Save icon, enter a description of your change, and hit `commit`.

Your change will be entered into the [pull request queue for discussion](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/pulls) 
before being merged into the master version.

If you're more familiar with GitHub, you can of course use the standard fork / pull request model.

## Merging Changes

Changes will be merged when a quorum of existing contributors have approved the pull request with a 'thumbs-up' symbol in the comments. Any contributor can block a merge by including a 'thumbs-down' symbol, as long as they include constructive reasoning and alternative proposals.

Once an author has had a change merged in, they will become an existing contributor and thus can vote on new changes.

## The Rules

* *Anything* can be changed.
* All contributions and discussions are public, and should take place as part of a pull request.
* Plain English is essential - follow the GDS style guide if you can. Try to avoid political weasel-words.
* Make changes small, self-contained, and simple. Large changes will take a lot longer to get merged. Small is agile.
* All content is public domain. By submitting a change, you agree that you are putting your work into the public domain. See [the full license](license.html) for details.
