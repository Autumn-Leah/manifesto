1. Get a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) and log in.
2. Find the page you want to edit, and click the `Edit` link at the top right.
3. Make your change in the editor.
4. Click the Save icon, enter a description of your change, and hit `commit`.

Your change will be entered into the [pull request queue for discussion](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/pulls) 
before being merged into the master version.

If you're more familiar with GitHub, you can of course use the standard fork / pull request model.

## Merging Changes

For now, changes will be merged based on a simple vote in each pull request. Authors of successful changes will be given direct access, and can vote on future changes. This will have to change in future, but it will do to start with.

## The Rules

* *Anything* can be changed.
* All contributions and discussions are public, and should take place as part of a pull request.
* Plain English is essential - follow the GDS style guide if you can. Try to avoid political weasel-words.
* Make changes small, self-contained, and simple. Large changes will take a lot longer to get merged. Small is agile.
* All content is public domain. By submitting a change, you agree that you are putting your work into the public domain. See [the full license](license.html) for details.
