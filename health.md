## National Health Service

In order to support every citizen's basic right to medical care and health services, we will maintain and enhance the NHS, keeping it as a free service available to anyone in the UK.

In order to deliver a high quality of care in the NHS, the government must provide sufficient funding and investment in the system.

The NHS will not deny care to anyone for any reason, regardless of legal status, economic status, or nationality (for further details, see [doitreatthisimmigrant.com](http://doitreatthisimmigrant.com/)).

We have a "free at the point of delivery" National Health Service and for good reason - a healthy population is a productive population, and that reaps benefits for all. That does not however extend to an area of our health that influences our ability to eat and drink and that when not maintained adequately can lead to cancer.
Care of the mouth and teeth should be brought fully under the National Health Service and free at the point of delivery, sweeping away the often prohibitive costs for the poorest in society and ensuring that our world class health care system continues to beat it's international counterparts in keeping the nation in good health.
