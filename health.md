## National Health Service

In order to support every citizen's basic right to medical care and health services, we will maintain and enhance the NHS, keeping it as a free service available to anyone in the UK.

In order to deliver a high quality of care in the NHS, the government must provide sufficient funding and investment in the system.

The NHS will not deny care to anyone for any reason, regardless of legal status, economic status, or nationality (for further details, see [doitreatthisimmigrant.com](http://doitreatthisimmigrant.com/)).
