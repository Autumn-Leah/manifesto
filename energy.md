What policies should we propose to ensure security and sustainability of our energy supply?

## Decarbonisation

We will aim to decarbonise the electricity supply by 2030, through a combination of renewable generation and new nuclear 
power (including alternative nuclear generation methods such as Thorium power). Fossil fuel plants will be allowed to operate
only if capturing 100% of their carbon emissions using CCS technology.

## Buy Back Scheme

Putting in place longer term, fixed rate energy buy back schemes will help the small scale, do it yourself renewable market flourish. 

A longer term fixed rate buy back will also allow more people to get finance for installations on or near their homes.

Remove confusing limitations currently in place about installations not created by accredited organisations to help individuals and small businesses get started.

Simplify buy back rates so that solar, wind, hydro and all other renewables share the same fixed tarrif so as not to discriminate any one technology.
