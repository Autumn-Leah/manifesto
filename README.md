# The OpenPolitics Manifesto

This is an experiment in collaboratively creating a political movement.

You can read the manifesto by looking at the [main website](http://openpolitics.org.uk).

## How to take part

This repository stores the full text and history of the manifesto. Anyone can change or add something. See [the contributor guide](http://openpolitics.org.uk/contributing.html) for details on how to start making your own changes.

You can also raise issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/issues) for things that you think need doing.

## To Do

There are plenty of areas where we don't yet have anything in the manifesto. If you're looking to contribute but are unsure where to start, why not have a look at one of these areas?

* Israel-Palestine conflict
* Scottish independence/the West Lothian question ([related discussion](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/issues/28))
* Leveson and media plurality
* Arts funding
* House building
* Local Government ([seems light](http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto/local_government.html))

Think there's other things we're missing but don't have a proposal of your own? Edit this page to add them!
