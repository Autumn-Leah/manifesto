# The OpenPolitics Manifesto

This is an experiment in collaboratively creating a political manifesto. You can [read and contribute to the manifesto online](http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto), and you can also take a look at the [list of proposals currently under discussion](https://votebot.openpolitics.org.uk/proposals).

## How to take part

Anyone can change or add something. Just visit the manifesto pages, and click "Suggest a change" to get involved.

See [the contributor guide](http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto/contributing.html) for full details on how it all works.

## Ideas

There are plenty of areas where we don't yet have anything in the manifesto. If you're looking to contribute but are unsure where to start, why not have a look at the ideas list?
 tracker](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/labels/policy) has a load of ideas. 
 
 Feel free to add your own too using the [issue form](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/issues/new?labels=idea)!
