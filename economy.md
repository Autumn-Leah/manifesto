What policies should we propose to maintain a competitive economy that provides sufficient employment?

## Taxation

### Income Tax

The personal income tax allowance will be set at the level of a full time living wage (currently £14,458.50 based on 252 working days of 7.5 hours per day at £7.65) and will rise inline with the living wage.

## Housing

Stamp Duty Land Tax (paid on house purchases) should be reformed, with tax band thresholds based on the regional average house price. Purchases up to the regional average price should be zero-rated. In addition, the 'slab' approach of current taxation will be changed to an incremental approach, where only the amount above a threshold is taxed at that rate.
