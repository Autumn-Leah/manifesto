What policies should we propose to maintain a competitive economy that provides sufficient employment?

## Taxation

### Income Tax

The personal income tax allowance will be set at the level of a full time living wage (currently £14,458.50 based on 252 working days of 7.5 hours per day at £7.65) and will rise inline with the living wage.

## Housing

Stamp Duty on house purchases should be reformed, with purchases tax-free below the 1.5x the national average house price, and a flat 3% tax applied on the amount above that threshold. This is broadly in line with the [recommendations from Stamp Duty Reform UK](http://stampdutyreform.org.uk/stamp-duty-the-future/), except that the threshold is not a fixed number, but is based on the housing market, thus keeping the lower end of the market tax-free in perpetuity.
