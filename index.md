The current political parties in the UK are not serving the public interest. There is not enough choice, little informed debate, and no challenge to the prevailing narrative. Those of us who believe in, and are working towards, a better future have nobody to represent us.

We believe that a better kind of government is possible; one based on openness, transparency, evidence, and citizen engagement. We believe that it is time for those of us who have a stake in the future to stand up, and change the system from the inside.

## The Manifesto

We are writing a manifesto for a new kind of politics, but the whole point is that we build it together. [It's easy to contribute](contributing.html). Do you feel strongly about some area of government policy? Why not add your ideas? Perhaps you can see something on here you disagree with? Nothing on this site is set in stone - everything and anything is up for discussion, amending, or changing entirely. Your contribution doesn't have to be huge - everything helps!

We are currently not a registered political party, and do not know if we intend to become one, but we are aiming to have a complete-enough manifesto to be able to support candidates (either within a party or independent) in the 2015 general and local elections.
