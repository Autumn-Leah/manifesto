The current political parties in the UK are not serving the public interest. There is not enough choice, little informed debate, and no challenge to the prevailing narrative. Those of us who believe in, and are working towards, a better future have nobody to represent us.

We believe that a better kind of government is possible; one based on openness, transparency, evidence, and citizen engagement. We believe that it is time for those of us who have a stake in the future to stand up, and change the system from the inside.

## The Manifesto

We are writing a manifesto for a new kind of politics, but the whole point is that we build it together. [It's easy to contribute](contributing.html). Do you feel strongly about some area of government policy? Why not add your ideas? Your contribution doesn't have to be huge - everything helps!

We are currently not a registered political party, but ideally, we will have a complete-enough manifesto, and enough people involved, that we can put up candidates in the 2015 general election.
