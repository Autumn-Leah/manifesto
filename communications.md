What policies do we need to adopt regarding communications technologies like the Internet?

## Surveillance

All communications (whether physical or digital) by individuals and groups, should be considered private property and free from state surveillance (or surveillance by agents or companies working on behalf of, or at the behest of, the State) without a judicially approved warrant in relation to a specific threat.

## Censorship

Remove all government-mandated filtering of Internet content, and make censorship by the government unconstitutional.

ISPs may give users the option to apply content filters on their connections, and even enable them by default if they wish, but filter lists must be openly published, and subject to review and appeal through OFCOM.
