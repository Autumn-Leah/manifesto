How can we improve the democratic process, and citizens' engagement with it?

## Elections

Allow for full and proper recall of MPs: any e-petition to recall their MP supported by 20% of all registered constituency electors should trigger a local referendum (yes/no majority vote required) as to whether to hold a fresh bi-election.

Introduce an 'None of the Above' box on all ballot papers to formally and positively register abstention.

Introduce voting by proportional representation (Single Transferable Vote) in all General and Local Elections.

## Party Funding

Limit all donations and loans to political parties, campaign, lobbying and interest groups to a maximum of Â£5,000 from individuals and groups.

## Lords Reform

Create an elected Upper House of Parliament for single 15 year terms, with the explicit purpose of revising and improving (not vetoing) legislation initiated by HM Government in the House of Commons.

## Transparency

Require all MPs to publish details of any meeting with any individual or group who is not a constituent.

## Devolution

Devolve all legislative powers currently enjoyed by the Scottish Parliament to equivalent devolved Parliaments in England, Wales and (eventually) Northern Ireland. The UK Parliament to retain control over macro-economic, foreign, and defence policy. 

## MPs pay and expenses

MPs should be paid a good wage, based on the income profile of the country. It could, for instance, be set at the 75th income percentile, though this is not a final proposal. All MPs would receive this same wage, which would change on an annual basis as the average wage changes.

Serving MPs should not hold second jobs unless they can show that there is no conflict with their role as MP, both in terms of time required and conflict of interest. This includes directorships and advisory posts.

Allowed expenses would be reduced to only those costs incurred as part of their job; for instance, travel and accomodation.

Second home allowances will be scrapped, and an MPs 'hotel' will be created, providing standard apartments for them to use when staying in London.
