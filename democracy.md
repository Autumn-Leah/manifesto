How can we improve the democratic process, and citizens' engagement with it?

## MPs pay and expenses

MPs should be paid a good wage, based on the income profile of the country. It could, for instance, be set at the 75th income percentile, though this is not a final proposal. All MPs would receive this same wage, which would change on an annual basis as the average wage changes.

Serving MPs will not allowed to hold other jobs at the same time as holding office, paid or unpaid. They may not hold directorships or advisory posts.

Allowed expenses would be reduced to only those costs incurred as part of their job; for instance, travel and accomodation.

Second home allowances will be scrapped, and an MPs 'hotel' will be created, providing standard apartments for them to use when staying in London.
