What should we do to enhance culture, and how should we ensure a robust but ethical media landscape?

## Copyright Reform

Reform copyright law to allow use for parody[^1].

Reform copyright law to allow format-shifting of purchased media (for example, from CD to MP3)[^1].

## Advertising

Encourage the Advertising Standards Authority to tighten regulations around the use of pseudo-scientific language and terminology for the promotion of cosmetic, toiletry, food or other products, without sufficient evidence.
