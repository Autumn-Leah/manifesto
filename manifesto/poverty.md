We believe that until poverty is adequately addressed, inequality will continue to increase throughout the United Kingdom. Successive governments have failed to address the causes and some policies have served only to exacerbate the problem.

## Low Pay and Job Security

To give the public greater financial security we will;

* [Make the minimum wage a living wage](economy.html)
* [Consider introducing a basic income to lift everyone out of poverty](economy.html)

## Government Action

The Office for Budget Responsibility will be given a new role in accessing and forecasting levels of poverty, while the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission will have it's remit extended to the whole of the UK to more effectively hold the government to account[^1].
