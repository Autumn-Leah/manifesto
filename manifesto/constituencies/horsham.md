## Fracking

Our national manifesto [bans new fossil fuel extraction](/manifesto/energy.html#fossil-fuel-industry)
in the UK, as the only way to sufficiently reduce emissions from fossil fuels is
to leave them in the ground. This means we are opposed to fracking for oil or natural gas, both in the Weald and all across the UK.
