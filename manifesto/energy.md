What policies should we propose to ensure security and sustainability of our energy supply?

## Decarbonisation

We will aim to decarbonise the electricity supply by 2030, through a combination of renewable generation and new nuclear 
power (including alternative nuclear generation methods such as Thorium power). Fossil fuel plants will be allowed to operate
only if capturing 100% of their carbon emissions using CCS technology.

## Green Power for the Public Sector

In order to stimulate the renewable power sector, all public sector organisations and [National Infrastructure Organisations](infrastructure.html) will be required to buy as much of their power as possible from zero-carbon sources, with a target to reach 100% as soon as possible.

## Buy Back Scheme

Putting in place longer term, fixed rate energy buy back schemes will help the small scale, do it yourself renewable market flourish. 

A longer term fixed rate buy back will also allow more people to get finance for installations on or near their homes.

Remove confusing limitations currently in place about installations not created by accredited organisations to help individuals and small businesses get started.

Simplify buy back rates so that solar, wind, hydro and all other renewables share the same fixed tarrif so as not to discriminate any one technology.

## Fossil Fuel Industry

Forbid new fossil fuel extraction in the UK (such as oil drilling, fracking, or coal mining), except for non-combustion industrial purposes such as production of plastics or pharmaceuticals.
