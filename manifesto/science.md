How do we stimulate and support scientific discovery in the UK?

## Compulsory Purchase in the Public Interest

Patents and other forms of IP are used excercised for many globally important scientific and medical examples. Such protection is necessary for the organisations that produce the advancements, as they need to recoup the costs. A side effect, however, is that crucial cures and the like are subject to high costs and so spread slower than they perhaps could.

We will investigate a form of compulsory purchase aimed at important scientific advancements that would then place those advancements under an open license, encouraging wider use at lower cost.

Of huge importance to the investigation will be the need to establish a method of compensation that the scientific community can trust. Avoiding a chilling effect is essential - the comulsory purchase should be there to aid the adoption of advancements, not stifle research in the first place.
