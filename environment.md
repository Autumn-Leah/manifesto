What policies should we propose to protect our environment?

Policy: Nationwide programme of home insulation installation
------------------------------------------------------------

Itâ€™s widely acknowledged that insulation (eg cavity wall or loft) is the biggest, quickest way of improving the energy efficiency of the nation's housing stock.

Whilst many people have taken it upon themselves to install insulation, and there have been some limited local authority programmes, this should be accelerated through a nationwide programme.

The most efficient way of achieving the programme will be on a street-by-street basis, where homeowners and residents get a personal visit from a trained assessor, and then offered assistance in installing insultation by offering pre-approved suppliers at a reduced, pre-negotiated rate. Subsidy should be offered to homeowners with low incomes. As well as helping to arrange installation, the programme's staff would offer to manage the insulation, overseeing the work so that the resident doesn't need to take any time off work.

Landlords should be compelled to install insulation if the tenants accept the programme, and restricted from immediately raising rental prices.

The programme should be supported by a nationwide communications campaign and local community organising.

The target should be that at least 95% of residential buildings should have adequate insulation by 2020.
